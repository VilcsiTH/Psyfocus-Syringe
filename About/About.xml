	<description>Adds usable syringes, one which fully recharges the psyfocus of the user, and another which fully removes the neural heat of the user.
They can be obtained from quests as rewards or bought from exotic traders, very rarely.

In the future, there might be a craftable version of them that recharges less.</description>
